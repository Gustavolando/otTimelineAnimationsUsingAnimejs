## Timeline Animations using Anime js | How to make Animated Website

This is a simple but cool timeline animation using Anime JS lib.

I practiced here positions, transformations, the CSS mix-blend-mode property and several animation effects using the Anime JS library.

Colorful and elegant HTML, CSS and JS code.
